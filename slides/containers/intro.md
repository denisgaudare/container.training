## Hands on, you shall practice

- Nobody ever became a Jedi by spending their lives reading Wookiepedia

- Likewise, it will take more than merely *reading* these slides
  to make you an expert

- These slides include *tons* of demos, exercises, and examples

- They assume that you have access to a Kubernetes cluster

- If you are attending a workshop or tutorial:
  <br/>you will be given specific instructions to access your cluster

- If you are doing this on your own:
  <br/>the first chapter will give you various options to get your own cluster
